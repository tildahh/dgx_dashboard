# DGX Spark Dashboard

A simple dashboard for the DGX Spark with some slight differences to the built-in dashboard:

- Binds to `0.0.0.0` so it can be accessed over the network without an SSH tunnel
- Uses `MemTotal` and `MemAvailable` for accurate memory stats
- Includes GPU power draw
- Includes CPU usage
- Includes GPU and system temperatures
- Includes stats in browser tab title

Metrics update every 5s and are only collected while there is a connected client.
